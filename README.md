This App will read the images in the pages directory of the CouchDB Doc that it resides on.  Coupling data with the application to view it is an interesting idea but difficult to maintain.  This app will soon be rewritten to take the Document context from a GET parameter in the URL as opposed to sniffing it out of the CouchDB URL.
